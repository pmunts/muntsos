MuntsOS Embedded Linux
======================

This framework supports Linux on several single board microcomputers.
The goal of the MuntsOS project is to deliver a turnkey, RAM resident
Linux operating system for very low cost single board microcomputers.
With MuntsOS installed, such microcomputers can treated as components,
as *Linux microcontrollers*, and integrated into other projects just
like traditional single chip microcontrollers.

News
----

-   1 January 2024 -- I have decided to suspend active development for
    32-bit platforms. The 32-bit BeagleBone kernel is frozen at 5.4.106.
    The 32-bit Raspberry Pi 1 and 2 kernels are frozen at 5.15.92. The
    32-bit extensions, kernels and thin servers will still be rebuilt
    from time to time to incorporate userland improvements. The
    **`muntsos-dev`** package has been updated to only pull in 64-bit
    AArch toolchains.

-   1 January 2024 -- The 64-bit Raspberry Pi 3 and 4 kernels have been
    upgraded to 6.1.69 and will track
    <https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux> again.

-   6 January 2024 -- Added a libusb extension package. It just installs
    **`/usr/local/lib/libusb-1.0.so.0`**, which is no longer included in
    the kernel RAM file system.

-   6 January 2024 -- In the course of porting MuntsOS to the 64-bit
    [Raspberry Pi
    5](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-5) and the
    [Orange Pi Zero 2
    W](http://www.orangepi.org/orangepiwiki/index.php/Orange_Pi_Zero_2W),
    the previous naming convention for MuntsOS AArch64 (arm64) extension
    packages with "RaspberryPi3" has proven shortsighted. Therefore the
    extension package naming scheme has updated to be more meaningful
    for all platforms:

    **`dma-muntsos-BeagleBone.deb`**   becomes **`dma-muntsos-armhf-beaglebone.deb`**  
    **`dma-muntsos-RaspberryPi1.deb`** becomes **`dma-muntsos-armhf-raspberrypi1.deb`**  
    **`dma-muntsos-RaspberryPi2.deb`** becomes **`dma-muntsos-armhf-raspberrypi2.deb`**  
    **`dma-muntsos-RaspberryPi3.deb`** becomes **`dma-muntsos-aarch64.deb`**

-   7 January 2024 -- Except for porting MuntsOS to the Raspberry Pi 5,
    which is ongoing, I have caught up with my backlog of improvements
    and fixes. Among other things, the MuntsOS startup scripts
    (**`/etc/rc`**) and friends have been extensively reworked to
    prevent race conditions. These changes also improve the system boot
    time. Support for the Raspberry 5 and the Orange Pi Zero 2 W is
    under development.

-   13 January 2024 -- You can now write programs for MuntsOS in
    Modula-2, for which support was merged into GCC 13. During the late
    1980's and early 1990's, there was a lot of interest in Modula-2 as
    a system programming language, a more robust alternative to C. As a
    student and beginning software engineer, I spent real money on at
    least three different Modula-2 compilers for MS-DOS. Some platform
    modules and test programs have been moved from
    **[libsimpleio](https://github.com/pmunts/libsimpleio)** to
    **`muntsos/examples/modula2/`.**

-   13 January 2024 -- Upgraded libcurl to 8.5.0. Upgraded libnl to
    3.9.0. Took advantage of the opportunity to fix the cross-tool
    package dependency chains. Now if you remove the gcc package, all
    the corresponding free pascal compiler and library packages will be
    removed as well.

-   20 January 2024 -- Added two new device tree overlays:
    **`disable-ethernet-pi4`** and **`disable-ethernet-pi5`**. These
    disable the on-board Ethernet interface, exactly like
    **`disable-wifi`** disables the on-board WiFi interface. These are
    useful for boards like the
    [CM4-Duino](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/CM4-Duino), which doesn't
    have an Ethernet connector.

-   22 January 2024 -- First cut at the Raspberry Pi 5 kernel is done.
    Much testing and verification needs to be performed.

-   24 January 2024 -- Reworked the RPM setup scripts
    [setup-fedora](http://git.munts.com/muntsos/scripts/setup-fedora)
    and [setup-rhel](http://git.munts.com/muntsos/scripts/setup-rhel) to
    improve the user experience and to interoperate with
    [Alire](https://alire.ada.dev) better. Verified on Fedora 39 and
    RHEL lookalikes.

-   25 January 2024 -- Validation of the Raspberry Pi 5 port continues,
    with few issues found. I did have to implement a fix for a breaking
    GPIO API change, though, described in [Application Note
    \#11](http://git.munts.com/muntsos/doc/AppNote11-link-gpiochip.pdf).

-   26 January 2024 -- I have now implemented *BeagleBone Style* GPIO
    pin configuration managment for 64-bit Raspberry Pi boards, using
    the **`pinctrl`** command imported from Raspberry Pi OS. See
    [Application Note
    \#12](http://git.munts.com/muntsos/doc/AppNote12-pinctrl.pdf) for
    more information.

-   30 January 2024 -- Added a [Python3](https://www.python.org) runtime
    extension package. Python is not my favorite programming language,
    but it can be useful, and other people seem to like it. The
    **`python3`** program source has been patched to disable byte code
    caching. Byte code caching doesn't make much sense in an embedded
    system and it increases the storage footprint significantly. The
    Python3 extension includes **`libffi.so`** and Linux Simple I/O
    Library bindings for Python3.

-   3 February 2024 -- Upgraded ethtool to 6.7. Fixed an annoying
    backspace problem by adding **`crterase`** to the **`stty`** command
    in **`/etc/profile`**.

-   10 February 2024 -- Upgraded the Linux kernel to 6.1.77. The
    **[libsimpleio](https://github.com/pmunts/libsimpleio)** bindings
    for GNU Modula-2 are now complete. Added [Application Note
    \#14](http://git.munts.com/muntsos/doc/AppNote14-Flash-LED-Modula2.pdf),
    *Modula-2 LED Flash Example*.

-   28 February 2024 -- Enabled CPU frequency scaling on 64-bit
    Raspberry Pi boards. The default CPU frequency policy is
    **`performance`** for Raspberry Pi 3 and 4 and **`conservative`**
    for Raspberry Pi 5. The policy can be changed at boot time by
    writing the desired policy name to **`/etc/scaling_governor`** and
    running **`sysconfig --save`**. Note that the Raspberry Pi 3 and 4
    I<sup>2</sup>C and SPI clock frequencies scale with the CPU
    frequency, and will only be correct at the maximum CPU frequency,
    which can be guaranteed by the **`performance`** policy. The
    Raspberry Pi 5 I<sup>2</sup>C and SPI clock frequencies are
    independent of the CPU frequency.

-   28 March 2024 -- Reworked Raspberry Pi LED configuration. LEDs are
    now configured in **`config.txt`** instead of in **`/etc/rc`**.

-   5 April 2024 -- Upgraded 64-bit Raspberry Pi kernels to 6.6.23, the
    latest longterm Linux kernel.

-   6 April 2024 -- Upgraded 64-bit Raspberry Pi kernels to 6.6.25.
    Upgraded OpenSSH to 9.7p1. Stopped using prebuilt OpenSSH server
    keys. Generate only 4096 bit RSA OpenSSH server keys in
    **`/etc/rc`** (if necessary) and **`sysconfig`**.

-   11 April 2024 -- Upgraded some library components: libusb to 1.0.27,
    openssl to 3.3.0, curl to 8.7.1, rabbitmq-c to 0.14.0, libffi to
    3.4.6, and util-linux to 2.40. Added some new library components:
    libicu and libcap-ng.

-   12 April 2024 -- Upgraded some extension package components:
    emailrelay to 2.5.2, openvpn to 2.6.10, .Net Runtime to 8.0.4,
    python3 to 3.12.3, rsync to 3.3.0, net-snmp to 5.9.4, and tcpdump to
    4.99.4

-   7 May 2024 -- Upgraded 64-bit Raspberry Pi kernels to 6.6.30. Added
    **`enscript`** extension package. Added [Application Note
    \#17](http://git.munts.com/muntsos/doc/AppNote17-Printing.pdf) about
    printing from MuntsOS.

-   8 May 2024 -- Added **`gnuplot`** extension package. Only a few
    output formats (parameters to the **`set terminal`** plot command)
    are enabled, and even fewer are useful. In particular:

    **`set terminal postscript color`** is useful for printing, using a
    shell command like:

    **`gnuplot test.plt | lpr`**

    **`set terminal svg`** is useful for creating an image file suitable
    for post processing, using a shell command like:

    **`gnuplot test.plt > test.svg`**

Documentation
-------------

The documentation for MuntsOS (mostly application notes) is available
online at:

<http://git.munts.com/muntsos/doc>

Embedded Linux Distribution in a Kernel
---------------------------------------

MuntsOS is a stripped down Linux distribution that includes a small
compressed root file system within the kernel image binary itself. At
boot time the root file system is unpacked into RAM and thereafter the
system runs entirely in RAM.

Each kernel release tarball contains a kernel image file (**`.img`**),
which may be common to several different microcomputer boards, and one
or more [device tree](http://elinux.org/Device_Tree_Reference) files
(**`.dtb`**) that are specific to particular microcomputer boards. Some
kernel release tarballs also contain one or more device tree overlay
files (**`.dtbo`**) that can make small changes to the device tree at
boot time.

Prebuilt MuntsOS kernel release tarballs are available at:

<http://repo.munts.com/muntsos/kernels>

Extensions
----------

The MuntsOS root file system can be *extended* at boot time using any of
three mechanisms:

First, if **`/boot/tarballs`** exists, any **`gzip`**'ed tarball files
(**`.tgz`**) in it will be extracted on top of the root file system.
Typically you would use this mechanism for customized **`/etc/passwd`**,
**`.ssh/authorized_keys`**, and similiar system configuration files.

Secondly, if **`/boot/packages`** exists, any Debian package files
(**`.deb`**) in it will be installed into the root file system. Note
that packages from the [Debian](http://www.debian.org) project will
probably not work; they must be built specifically for MuntsOS. The
startup script that installs **`.deb`** packages also installs
**`.rpm`** and **`.nupkg`** packages.

The [GPIO Server](http://git.munts.com/muntsos/extensions/gpio-server)
extension package demonstrates how to build a Debian package that adds
application specific software to MuntsOS.

Thirdly, the system startup script **`/etc/rc`** can be configured via a
kernel command line option to search for a subdirectory called
**`autoexec.d`** in various places, such as SD card, USB flash drive,
USB CD-ROM or NFS mount. If an **`autoexec.d`** subdirectory is found,
each executable program or script in it will be executed when the system
boots.

The idea is to build a MuntsOS kernel (which takes a long time) once and
install it to the target platform. Then application specific software
can be built after the fact and installed as tarball files in
**`/boot/tarballs`**; Debian, RPM, and NuGet package files in
**`/boot/packages`**; or executable programs and scripts in
**`/boot/autoexec.d`**.

Prebuilt MuntsOS extension packages are available at:

<http://repo.munts.com/muntsos/extensions>

Thin Servers
------------

### Boot Files + Kernel Files + Extensions = Thin Server

The *Thin Server* is a system design pattern that is little more than a
network interface for a single I/O device. Ideally, a Thin Server will
be built from a cheap and ubiquitous network microcomputer like the
Raspberry Pi. The software must be easy to install from a user's PC or
Mac without requiring any special programming tools. It must be able to
run headless, administered via the network. It must be able to survive
without orderly shutdowns, and must not write much to flash media. It
must provide a network based API (Application Programming Interface)
using HTTP as a lowest common denominator.

MuntsOS, with its operating system running entirely from RAM, serves
well for the Thin Server, and the two concepts have evolved together
over the past few years. The simplest way to use MuntsOS is to download
one of the prebuilt Thin Server **`.zip`** files and extract it to a
freshly formatted FAT32 SD card. You can then modify
**`autoexec.d/00-wlan-init`** on the SD card to pre-configure it for
your wireless network environment, if desired, before inserting it in
the target board. After booting MuntsOS, log in from the console or via
SSH (user "**`root`**", password "**`default`**") and run
**`sysconfig`** to perform more system configuration.

*Note: Some platforms require the [boot
flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boot_flag) to be set on the FAT32
boot partition on the SD card or on-board eMMC. The ROM boot loader in
the CPU will ignore any partitions that are not marked as bootable.*

Boards
------

### Raspberry Pi

The [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.com) is a family of low cost
Linux microcomputers selling for USD $15 to $80, depending on model.
There have been five generations of Raspberry Pi microcomputers, each
using a successively more sophisticated Broadcom ARM core CPU. The first
two generations (32-bit ARMv6 Raspberry Pi 1 and 32-bit ARMv7 Raspberry
Pi 2) are now obsolete.

Some Raspberry Pi models have an on-board Bluetooth radio that uses the
serial port signals that are brought out to the expansion header. By
default, MuntsOS port disables the on-board Bluetooth radio, in favor of
the serial port on the expansion header.

#### Raspberry Pi 3

The 64-bit [Raspberry Pi 2 Model
B](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b) Revision
1.2 with the 900 MHz BCM2710 ARMv8 Cortex-A53 quad-core CPU can be
treated as a power conserving Raspberry Pi 3 Model B− and is useful for
industrial applications where wired Ethernet is preferred.

The [Rasbperry Pi 3 Model
B](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b) has a
1200 MHz BCM2710 ARMv8 Cortex-A53 quad-core CPU and has 1 GB of RAM
along with on-board Bluetooth and WiFi radios.

The [Raspberry Pi 3 Model
A+](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-a-plus)
has the same form factor as the Raspberry Pi 1 Model A+, with only one
USB host port and no wired Ethernet. It has a 1400 MHz BCM2710 ARMv8
Cortex-A53 quad-core CPU and has 512 MB of RAM along with on-board
Bluetooth and WiFi radios.

The [Raspberry Pi 3 Model
B+](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus)
has a 1400 MHz BCM2710 ARMv8 Cortex-A53 quad-core CPU and has improved
power management and networking components.

The [Raspberry Pi Zero 2
W](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-2-w) has the
same form factor as the Raspberry Pi Zero W, with a 1000 MHz BCM2710
ARMv8 Cortex-A53 quad core CPU and 512 MB of RAM along with on-board
Bluetooth and WiFi radios.

All Raspberry Pi 3 models use the same AArch64 toolchain and ARMv8
kernels, but different device trees.

#### Raspberry Pi 4

The [Raspberry Pi 4 Model
B](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b) has a
1500 MHz BCM2711 ARMv8 Cortex-A72 quad-core CPU and is available with 1
to 8 GB of RAM. It diverged significantly from the Raspberry Pi 1 B+
form factor, with the USB and Ethernet ports reversed, two micro-HDMI
connectors instead of a single full size HDMI connector, and a USB-C
power connector instead of micro-USB. Two of the USB ports are 3.0 and
two are 2.0. A major improvement is a Gigabit Ethernet controller
connected via PCI Express instead of the USB connected Ethernet used for
all earlier models. The Raspberry Pi 4 Model B uses the same wireless
chip set as the 3+.

There are also a myriad of [Raspberry Pi 4 Compute
Modules](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/compute-module-4), with
varying combinations of wireless Ethernet, RAM and eMMC.

All Raspberry Pi 4 models use the same AArch64 toolchain and ARMv8
kernels, but different device trees.

#### Raspberry Pi 5

The [Raspberry Pi
5](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-5) yields another
2-3x increase in performance over the Raspberry Pi 4, at the expense of
greater power consumption. It has a 2400 MHz BCM2712 ARMv8 Cortex-A76
quad-core CPU and is available with 4 or 8 GB of RAM. The Ethernet
socket and USB ports have swapped sides, so it has a form factor that is
sort of a cross between the Raspberry Pi 1 B+ (same grouping of Ethernet
and USB ports) and the Raspberry Pi 4 (same dual micro-HDMI sockets and
USB-C power socket). It uses the same AArch64 toolchain as all of the
other 64-bit Raspberry Pi models, but a separate kernel and device tree.

The Raspberry Pi 5 introduced a breaking GPIO API change. See
[Application Note
\#11](http://git.munts.com/muntsos/doc/AppNote11-link-gpiochip.pdf) for
more information.

The Raspberry Pi 5 also introduced a breaking PWM API change. It has
four hardware PWM outputs, but the pin mapping has changed as well.
Notably, channel 2 is mapped to GPIO18 instead of channel 0 on previous
Raspberry Pi boards. See [RP1
Peripherals](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/rp1/rp1-peripherals.pdf)
page 15 for more information.

#### Raspberry Pi USB Gadget Kernels

MuntsOS also provides Raspberry Pi kernels with dedicated [USB
Gadget](http://www.linux-usb.org/gadget) support enabled. These kernels
run on 3 A+, CM3, Zero 2 W, 4 B, and CM4. You can supply power to and
communicate with a compatible Raspberry Pi solely through the USB port.
This kernel supports USB Network, Raw HID, and Serial Port gadgets,
selected by bits in the **`OPTIONS`** word passed on the kernel command
line. The USB Gadget Thin Servers have USB Network Gadget selected by
default.

The absolute minimum possible usable Raspberry Pi kit consists of a
Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, a micro-USB cable, and a micro-SD card with one
of the MuntsOS Raspberry Pi 3 USB Gadget Thin Servers installed.

Cross-Toolchains
----------------

I build a custom Ada/C/C++/Fortran/Go/Modula-2 GCC cross-toolchain for
each MuntsOS platform family. Each GCC cross-toolchain requires a number
of additional software component libraries, which are packaged and
distributed separately but installed into the same directory tree as the
parent cross-toolchain. I also build [Free
Pascal](https://www.freepascal.org) cross-compilers. Each of these rely
on the libraries contained in the corresponding GCC cross-toolchain
package.

Cross-toolchain packages built for [Debian](https://www.debian.org)
Linux (x86-64 *and* ARM64) development host computers are available at
either:

<http://repo.munts.com/debian12> (Debian package repository) or
<http://repo.munts.com/muntsos/toolchain-debs> (just the package files).

x86-64 RPM packages containing the exact same binaries and known to work
on Fedora 40 and RHEL 9.1 and its derivatives are available at:
