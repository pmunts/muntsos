<h1><b>MuntsOS</b> Embedded Linux</h1>
<p><b>MuntsOS</b> is a <i>ferociously</i> reduced Linux distribution for
<b>embedded systems</b>. It runs on several microcomputer boards, including all
64-bit <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/">Raspberry Pi</a> models,
providing a turnkey RAM resident Linux operating system. With <b>MuntsOS</b>
installed, a small and low cost Linux microcomputer becomes a <i>Linux
microcontroller</i>, and can be integrated into an embedded system just like a
single chip microcontroller but coming with a much, much richer development
ecosystem.</p>
<p>Other embedded system Linux distributions such as <a href=
"https://buildroot.org">Buildroot</a> or <a href=
"https://www.yoctoproject.org">Yocto Linux</a> are <i>very</i> cumbersome and
have <i>very</i> steep learning curves. If you are building a test fixture or
process controller or almost any other embedded system that contains a
Raspberry Pi board, <b>MuntsOS</b> offers a very high productivity development
environment and a very easy to deploy target operating system.</p>
<h2>News</h2>
<ul>
<li>17 December 2024 -- Moved all 32-bit target deliverables (toolchain
packages, kernels, extensions, and thin servers) to <a href=
"http://repo.munts.com/muntsos/attic">http://repo.munts.com/muntsos/attic</a>.
I did a final build of the 32-bit target kernels with <b><tt>sysconfig</tt></b>
modified to fetch extensions from the attic. I do not anticipate ever building
the 32-bit target kernels or thin servers again.</li>
<li>
<p>20 December 2024 -- Upgraded the Raspberry Pi kernel to 6.6.67. Added a new
device tree overlay, <b><tt>Pi4ClickShield</tt></b>, to support the eponymous
<a href="https://www.mikroe.com/pi-4-click-shield">mikroBUS shield</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>26 December 2024 -- Added <i>preliminary</i> support for the <a href=
"http://www.orangepi.org/orangepiwiki/index.php/Orange_Pi_Zero_2W">Orange Pi
Zero 2W</a>. I have the <a href="https://www.u-boot.org">U-Boot</a> boot loader
and the Linux mainline 6.12 LTS kernel, both with serial port console, working
all the way to the login prompt. Much work on the kernel and device tree
remains before <b>MuntsOS</b> on the Orange Pi Zero 2W is ready for production
use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>28 December 2024 -- I had to drop back to the manufacturer Linux 6.1 kernel
tree for the Orange Pi Zero 2W. The Linux mainline 6.12 LTS tree does not have
drivers for PWM outputs nor the built-in WiFi chipset, both of which are
required for the application I have in mind. <b>MuntsOS</b> for the Orange Pi
Zero 2W built on Linux 6.1 is about at the same point or a litte further along
than what I had running on Linux 6.12 LTS. Most things seem to be working
except HDMI and internal WiFi. I have been testing with a <a href=
"https://uk.pi-supply.com/collections/dongles-hubs/products/broadcom-wifi-adapter-2-port-usb-hub-raspberry-pi">
Broadcom WiFi Adapter and Two Port Hub</a> I got years ago for the Raspberry Pi
Zero.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3 January 2025 -- Upgraded the Raspberry Pi Linux kernel to 6.6.69. Got the
Orange Pi Zero 2W console on USB keyboard / HDMI monitor working. Modified
<b><tt>/etc/inittab</tt></b> to support four virtual terminals on HDMI video
target platforms. Changed the kernel default <b><tt>printk</tt></b> quiet
priority level to 2, to suppress most <b><tt>printk</tt></b> noise to the
console. Added support for importing settings from
<b><tt>/etc/sysctl.conf</tt></b>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>4 January 2025 -- Added <b><tt>tclsh</tt></b>, <b><tt>expect</tt></b>, and
<b><tt>socat</tt></b> extension packages. <a href=
"https://www.tcl-lang.org">Tcl</a> is a scripting language that has been around
in the Unix world for a very long time, since 1988. <b><tt>tclsh</tt></b> is
the Tcl interpreter program. Some years ago I used Tcl for text fixture
automation, an application for which it is very well suited.</p>
<p><b><tt><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expect">expect</a></tt></b> is
both an extension to Tcl and a standalone program that is extremely useful for
automating a dialog between a computer and an I/O device with a serial port
interface. All manner of older lab instruments and other industrial equipment
had a serial port control interface, as do more modern devices such as the
<a href="https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp8266">ESP8266 WiFi
microcontroller</a>. Many modern instruments, such as my oscilloscope, have a
USB-B receptacle that enumerates as a serial port when plugged into a
computer.</p>
<p><b><tt><a href="https://manpages.org/socat">socat</a></tt></b> is a Linux
utility program that bridges two byte stream communications channels of various
kinds, such as <b><tt>stdin</tt></b>/<b><tt>stdout</tt></b> and a serial port,
in the case of the <b><tt>expect</tt></b> script I was using to configure the
ESP8266.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>8 January 2025 -- As I was preparing to begin work on USB Gadget mode for
the Orange Pi Zero 2W, I realized that, unlike the Raspberry Pi 3, the
Raspberry Pi 4 does not need a separate USB Gadget kernel. The old obsolete
BeagleBones, the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, and the Raspberry Pi 5 Model B all
have a USB controller dedicated to the USB Mini-A/USB micro-A/USB-C power
receptacle that is entirely separate from the USB controller dedicated to the
USB-A receptacle(s). The BeagleBone family never needed a separate USB Gadget
kernel and neither do the Raspberry Pi 4 or 5.</p>
<p>The direction (host or peripheral) of the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (and the
Raspberry Pi 5 Model B) USB-C receptacle is set in the device tree, by adding
either <b><tt>dtoverlay=dwc2,dr_mode=host</tt></b> or
<b><tt>dtoverlay=dwc2,dr_mode=peripheral</tt></b> to
<b><tt>/boot/config.txt</tt></b>. This may or may not work on CM4/CM5 carrier
boards: The <a href=
"https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/compute-module-4-io-board">Compute Module
4 IO Board</a> can be placed into USB peripheral mode but the <a href=
"https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/CM4-Duino">Waveshare CM4-Duino</a> cannot.
Negotiating USB peripheral mode seems to require USB OTG (On The Go)
configuration signals and/or resistors that are wired on the CM4 I/O Board but
not on the CM4-Duino.</p>
<p>This USB Gadget scheme works equally well on the Raspberry Pi 5 Model B and
I have enabled support for USB Gadget mode in the Raspberry Pi 5 kernel. Both
my Windows laptop and Dell tower running Debian Linux Bookworm are able to
supply enough current to their USB-A receptacles to power up a Raspberry Pi 5
Model B with 4 GB of RAM running <b>MuntsOS</b>. YMMV.</p>
<p>Just for the fun of it, I have added the <a href=
"https://github.com/ColinIanKing/stress-ng">stress-ng</a> extension package to
<b>MuntsOS</b> see how a Raspberry Pi 5 Model B would hold up drawing power
from the Dell tower's front panel USB-A receptacle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>9 January 2025 -- Another big milestone for the Orange Pi Zero 2W: USB
Gadget support is working. The Orange Pi Zero 2W has two USB-C receptacles. If
you orient the board vertically, with the micro-SD receptacle at the top, the
40-pin expansion bus on the right, and the HDMI and USB-C receptacles on the
left, the bottom USB-C receptacle (labeled <b><tt>TYPEC1</tt></b> on the
schematic diagram) is the USB peripheral receptacle and the one above it
(labeled <b><tt>TYPEC2</tt></b> on the schematic diagram) is the USB host
receptacle. You can supply power to either USB-C receptacle, but you will
almost always want to use the lower one for power and tethering and the upper
one for USB devices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>31 January 2025 -- Upgraded the Raspberry Pi kernel to 6.6.74, mailutils to
3.18, and nano editor to 8.3.</p>
<p>Backed out the <b><tt>link-gpiochip</tt></b> hack, since the Raspberry Pi
team has since fixed the Raspberry Pi 5 GPIO compatibility issue. The Raspberry
Pi 5 expansion header GPIO pins are back on <b><tt>gpiochip0</tt></b> like all
previous Raspberry Pi models. See this <a href=
"https://pip.raspberrypi.com/categories/685-app-notes-guides-whitepapers/documents/RP-006553-WP/A-history-of-GPIO-usage-on-Raspberry-Pi-devices-and-current-best-practices.pdf">
Application Note</a> for more information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>12 February 2025 -- Added <b><a href=
"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/libs/libgpiod/libgpiod.git/tree">libgpiod</a></b>
to the toolchain libraries packages
<b><tt>gcc-*-muntsos-linux-gnu-ctng-libs</tt></b> and added the <b>libgpiod</b>
runtime extension package. Because they use the same <b><tt>ioctl()</tt></b>
services, <b>libgpiod</b> and <b>libsimpleio</b> interoperate without any
problems. Note that this <b>libgpiod</b> is newer than that in Debian 12
(Bookworm), including Raspberry Pi OS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>17 February 2025 -- Upgraded the .Net Runtime to 9.0.2. Upgraded the
Raspberry Pi kernel to 6.6.78.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>20 February 2025 -- <a href=
"https://crosstool-ng.github.io">Crosstool-NG</a> release 1.27.0 was published
a few days ago. I have used it to build the 10th iteration of the
<b>MuntsOS</b> cross-toolchain packages, upgrading binutils to 2.43, GCC to
14.2.0, and glibc to 2.41. GCC 14.2.0 includes support for <a href=
"http://www.ada-auth.org/standards/ada22.html">Ada 2022</a> and a lot of
Modula-2 fixes. All of the extensions, kernels, and thin servers have been
rebuilt with the new GCC 14.2.0 toolchain. The previous GCC 13.2.0
cross-toolchain packages, extensions, kernels, and thin servers have been moved
to the <a href="http://repo.munts.com/muntsos/attic">attic.</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>23 February 2025 -- Added initial support for the 64-bit <a href=
"https://www.beagleboard.org/boards/beagleplay">BeaglePlay</a>. Next up will
probably be the 64-bit <a href="https://riscv.org">RISC-V</a> <a href=
"https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/VisionFive2">VisionFive 2</a>. I have
successfully built a GCC 14.2.0 <b><tt>riscv64</tt></b> cross-toolchain for
<b>MuntsOS</b>.</p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>The documentation for <b>MuntsOS</b> (mostly application notes) is available
online at:</p>
<p><a href=
"http://git.munts.com/muntsos/doc">http://git.munts.com/muntsos/doc</a></p>
<h2>Embedded Linux Distribution in a Kernel</h2>
<p><b>MuntsOS</b> is a stripped down Linux distribution that includes a small
compressed root file system within the kernel image binary itself. At boot time
the root file system is unpacked into RAM and thereafter the system runs
entirely in RAM. After <b>MuntsOS</b> has finished booting, it unmounts the
boot media, so you don't have to worry about an orderly shutdown. Just power
off the microcomputer board whenever you want to.</p>
<p>Each kernel release tarball contains a kernel image file
(<b><tt>.img</tt></b>), which may be common to several different microcomputer
boards, and one or more <a href=
"http://elinux.org/Device_Tree_Reference">device tree</a> files
(<b><tt>.dtb</tt></b>) that are specific to particular microcomputer boards.
Some kernel release tarballs also contain one or more device tree overlay files
(<b><tt>.dtbo</tt></b>) that can make small changes to the device tree at boot
time.</p>
<p>Prebuilt <b>MuntsOS</b> kernel release tarballs are available at:</p>
<p><a href=
"http://repo.munts.com/muntsos/kernels">http://repo.munts.com/muntsos/kernels</a></p>
<h2>Extensions</h2>
<p>The <b>MuntsOS</b> root file system can be <i>extended</i> at boot time
using any of three mechanisms:</p>
<p>First, if <b><tt>/boot/tarballs</tt></b> exists, any <b><tt>gzip</tt></b>'ed
tarball files (<b><tt>.tgz</tt></b>) in it will be extracted on top of the root
file system. Typically you would use this mechanism for customized
<b><tt>/etc/passwd</tt></b>, <b><tt>.ssh/authorized_keys</tt></b>, and similiar
system configuration files.</p>
<p>Secondly, if <b><tt>/boot/packages</tt></b> exists, any Debian package files
(<b><tt>.deb</tt></b>) in it will be installed into the root file system. Note
that packages from the <a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian</a> project will
probably not work; they must be built specifically for <b>MuntsOS</b>. The
startup script that installs <b><tt>.deb</tt></b> packages also installs
<b><tt>.rpm</tt></b> and <b><tt>.nupkg</tt></b> packages.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://git.munts.com/muntsos/extensions/gpio-server">GPIO
Server</a> extension package demonstrates how to build a Debian package that
adds application specific software to <b>MuntsOS</b>.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the system startup script <b><tt>/etc/rc</tt></b> can be configured
via a kernel command line option to search for a subdirectory called
<b><tt>autoexec.d</tt></b> in various places, such as SD card, USB flash drive,
USB CD-ROM or NFS mount. If an <b><tt>autoexec.d</tt></b> subdirectory is
found, each executable program or script in it will be executed when the system
boots.</p>
<p>The idea is to build a <b>MuntsOS</b> kernel (which takes a long time) once
and install it to the target platform. Then application specific software can
be built after the fact and installed as tarball files in
<b><tt>/boot/tarballs</tt></b>; Debian, RPM, and NuGet package files in
<b><tt>/boot/packages</tt></b>; or executable programs and scripts in
<b><tt>/boot/autoexec.d</tt></b>.</p>
<p>Prebuilt <b>MuntsOS</b> extension packages are available at:</p>
<p><a href=
"http://repo.munts.com/muntsos/extensions">http://repo.munts.com/muntsos/extensions</a></p>
<h2>Thin Servers</h2>
<h3>Boot Files + Kernel Files + Extensions = Thin Server</h3>
<p>The <i>Thin Server</i> is a system design pattern that is little more than a
network interface for a single I/O device. Ideally, a Thin Server will be built
from a cheap and ubiquitous network microcomputer like the Raspberry Pi. The
software must be easy to install from a user's PC or Mac without requiring any
special programming tools. It must be able to run headless, administered via
the network. It must be able to survive without orderly shutdowns, and must not
write much to flash media. It must provide a network based API (Application
Programming Interface) using HTTP as a lowest common denominator.</p>
<p><b>MuntsOS</b>, with its operating system running entirely from RAM, serves
well for the Thin Server, and the two concepts have evolved together over the
past few years. The simplest way to use <b>MuntsOS</b> is to download one of
the prebuilt Thin Server <b><tt>.zip</tt></b> files and extract it to a freshly
formatted FAT32 SD card. You can then modify
<b><tt>autoexec.d/00-wlan-init</tt></b> on the SD card to pre-configure it for
your wireless network environment, if desired, before inserting it in the
target board. After booting <b>MuntsOS</b>, log in from the console or via SSH
(user "<b><tt>root</tt></b>", password "<b><tt>default</tt></b>") and run
<b><tt>sysconfig</tt></b> to perform more system configuration.</p>
<p><i>Note: Some platforms require the <a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boot_flag">boot flag</a> to be set on the FAT32
boot partition on the SD card or on-board eMMC. The ROM boot loader in the CPU
will ignore any partitions that are not marked as bootable.</i></p>

<h2>Boards</h2>
<h3>BeaglePlay</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.beagleboard.org/boards/beagleplay">BeaglePlay</a>
is a small Linux microcomputer board with industry standard interfaces for
add-on I/O modules (a <a href="https://www.mikroe.com/mikrobus">mikroBUS</a>
socket, a <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic">QWIIC</a> socket, and a
<a href="https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove_System">Grove</a> socket) instead
of a general purpose expansion header. It has a Texas Instruments AM6254 ARMv8
Cortex-A53 quad core CPU and comes with 2 GB of RAM. The BeaglePlay has one
USB-A receptacle for peripheral devices and one USB-C receptacle for power and
tethering. It has a 10/100/1000BASE-T wired Ethernet interface, a <a href=
"https://www.analog.com/en/resources/technical-articles/the-new-10base-t1l-standard.html">
10BASE-T1L</a> single pair Ethernet interface (intended for a factory
automation network and worthless for any other purpose), and a <a href=

<h3>Orange Pi Zero 2W</h3>
<p>The <a href=

<h3>Raspberry Pi</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.com">Raspberry Pi</a> is a family of low
cost Linux microcomputers selling for USD $15 to $80, depending on model. There
have been five generations of Raspberry Pi microcomputers, each using a
successively more sophisticated Broadcom ARM core CPU. The first two
generations (32-bit ARMv6 Raspberry Pi 1 and 32-bit ARMv7 Raspberry Pi 2) are
now obsolete.</p>
<p>Some Raspberry Pi models have an on-board Bluetooth radio that uses the
serial port signals that are also brought out to the expansion header. By
default, <b>MuntsOS</b> port disables the on-board Bluetooth radio, in favor of
the serial port on the expansion header.</p>
<p>All of the following 64-bit Raspberry Pi models use the same AArch64
cross-toolchain.</p>
<h4>Raspberry Pi 3</h4>
<p>The <a href=
"https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b">Raspberry Pi 2
Model B</a> Revision 1.2 with the 900 MHz BCM2710 ARMv8 Cortex-A53 quad-core
CPU can be treated as a power conserving Raspberry Pi 3 Model B− and is useful
for industrial applications where wired Ethernet is preferred.</p>
<p>The <a href=
"https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b">Rasbperry Pi 3
Model B</a> has a 1200 MHz BCM2710 ARMv8 Cortex-A53 quad-core CPU and has 1 GB
of RAM along with on-board Bluetooth and WiFi radios.</p>
<p>The <a href=
"https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-a-plus">Raspberry Pi
3 Model A+</a> has the same form factor as the Raspberry Pi 1 Model A+, with
only one USB host receptacle and no wired Ethernet. It has a 1400 MHz BCM2710
ARMv8 Cortex-A53 quad-core CPU and has 512 MB of RAM along with on-board
Bluetooth and WiFi radios.</p>
<p>The <a href=
"https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus">Raspberry Pi
3 Model B+</a> has a 1400 MHz BCM2710 ARMv8 Cortex-A53 quad-core CPU and has
improved power management and networking components.</p>
<p>The <a href=
"https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-2-w">Raspberry Pi Zero
2 W</a> has the same form factor as the Raspberry Pi Zero W, with a 1000 MHz
BCM2710 ARMv8 Cortex-A53 quad core CPU and 512 MB of RAM along with on-board
Bluetooth and WiFi radios. This small, light, and inexpensive board is probably
one of the best Linux microcomputers available for implementing embedded
systems.</p>
<p>All Raspberry Pi 3 models use the same ARMv8 kernel, with different device
trees.</p>
<h5>USB Gadgets</h5>
<p><b>MuntsOS</b> also offers a second, different Raspberry Pi 3 kernel with
USB host support disabled and <a href="http://www.linux-usb.org/gadget">USB
Gadget</a> peripheral support enabled. This kernel only runs on 3 A+, Zero 2 W,
and certain CM3 carrier boards which lack the USB hub present on Raspberry Pi 3
Model B and B+ boards. The single USB controller that is part of the BCM2710
CPU is wired directly to the USB-A receptacle on the 3 A+ or the USB Micro-A
receptacle on the CM3 I/O board or the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W.</p>
<p>The Raspberry Pi 3 USB Gadget kernel supports USB Ethernet, Raw HID, and
Serial Port gadgets, selected by bits in the <b><tt>OPTIONS</tt></b> word
passed on the kernel command line (as configured in
<b><tt>/boot/cmdline.txt</tt></b>). See <a href=
"http://git.munts.com/muntsos/doc/AppNote10-OPTIONS.pdf">Application Note
#10</a> for more information about the <b><tt>OPTIONS</tt></b> word. Raspberry
Pi 3 USB Gadget Thin Servers have USB Network Gadget selected by default.</p>
<p>You can supply power to and communicate with a compatible Raspberry Pi 3
(A+, CM3, or Zero 2W) running the USB Gadget kernel through the USB receptacle.
The absolute minimum possible usable Raspberry Pi kit consists of a Raspberry
Pi Zero 2 W, a micro-USB cable, and a micro-SD card with one of the
<b>MuntsOS</b> Raspberry Pi 3 USB Gadget Thin Servers installed.</p>
<h4>Raspberry Pi 4</h4>
<p>The <a href=
"https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b">Raspberry Pi 4
Model B</a> has a 1500 MHz BCM2711 ARMv8 Cortex-A72 quad-core CPU and is
available with 1 to 8 GB of RAM. It diverged significantly from the Raspberry
Pi 1 B+ form factor, with the USB and Ethernet receptacles reversed, two
micro-HDMI receptacles instead of a single full size HDMI receptacle, and a
USB-C power receptacle instead of micro-USB. Two of the USB receptacles are 3.0
and two are 2.0. A major improvement is a Gigabit Ethernet controller connected
via PCI Express instead of the USB connected Ethernet used for all earlier
models. The Raspberry Pi 4 Model B uses the same wireless chip set as the
3+.</p>
<p>There are also a myriad of <a href=
"https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/compute-module-4">Raspberry Pi 4 Compute
Modules</a>, with varying combinations of wireless Ethernet, RAM and eMMC.</p>
<p>All Raspberry Pi 4 models use the same ARMv8 kernel, with different device
trees.</p>
<h5>USB Gadgets</h5>
<p>You will need to edit some boot configuration files to enable USB Gadget
mode. First, change <b><tt>dtoverlay=dwc2,dr_mode=host</tt></b> to
<b><tt>dtoverlay=dwc2,dr_mode=peripheral</tt></b> in
<b><tt>/boot/config.txt</tt></b> to change the USB-C receptacle from USB host
to USB peripheral. Then change the <b><tt>OPTIONS</tt></b> word in
<b><tt>/boot/cmdline.txt</tt></b> to <b><tt>0x132C</tt></b> for a USB HID
gadget, <b><tt>0x032E</tt></b> for a USB Ethernet gadget, or
<b><tt>0x03AC</tt></b> for a USB serial port gadget. See <a href=

<p>The Raspberry Pi 4 family consumes significantly more power than the
Raspberry Pi 3 and not all host computers will be able to supply enough current
to a single USB receptacle to support a Raspberry Pi 4 in USB Gadget mode.</p>
<h4>Raspberry Pi 5</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-5">Raspberry
Pi 5 Model B</a> yields another 2-3x increase in performance over the Raspberry
Pi 4, at the expense of greater power consumption. It has a 2400 MHz BCM2712
ARMv8 Cortex-A76 quad-core CPU and is available with 4 or 8 GB of RAM. The
Ethernet receptacle and USB receptacles have swapped sides, so it has a form
factor that is sort of a cross between the Raspberry Pi 1 B+ (same grouping of
Ethernet and USB receptacles) and the Raspberry Pi 4 (same dual micro-HDMI
receptacles and USB-C power receptacle).</p>
<p>There are also a myriad of <a href=
"https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/compute-module-5">Raspberry Pi 5 Compute
Modules</a>, with varying combinations of wireless Ethernet, RAM and eMMC.</p>
<p>All Raspberry Pi 5 models use the same ARMv8 kernel, with different device
trees.</p>
<p>The Raspberry Pi 5 introduced a breaking PWM (Pulse Width Modulated) output
API change: It has four hardware PWM outputs on <b><tt>pwmchip2</tt></b> (all
previous Raspberry Pi models had two PWM outputs on <b><tt>pwmchip0</tt></b>)
with different pin mapping. Notably, PWM chip 2 channel 2 is mapped to GPIO18
instead of PWM chip 0 channel 0 on previous Raspberry Pi boards. See <a href=
"https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/rp1/rp1-peripherals.pdf">RP1
Peripherals</a> page 15 for more information.</p>
<h5>USB Gadgets</h5>
<p>You will need to edit some boot configuration files to enable USB Gadget
mode. First, change <b><tt>dtoverlay=dwc2,dr_mode=host</tt></b> to
<b><tt>dtoverlay=dwc2,dr_mode=peripheral</tt></b> in
<b><tt>/boot/config.txt</tt></b> to change the USB-C receptacle from USB host
to USB peripheral. Then change the <b><tt>OPTIONS</tt></b> word in
<b><tt>/boot/cmdline.txt</tt></b> to <b><tt>0x132C</tt></b> for a USB HID
gadget, <b><tt>0x032E</tt></b> for a USB Ethernet gadget, or
<b><tt>0x03AC</tt></b> for a USB serial port gadget. See <a href=
"http://git.munts.com/muntsos/doc/AppNote10-OPTIONS.pdf">Application Note
#10</a> for more information about the <b><tt>OPTIONS</tt></b> word.</p>
<p>The Raspberry Pi 5 family consumes even more power than the Raspberry Pi 4
and not all host computers will be able to supply enough current to a single
USB receptacle to support a Raspberry Pi 5 in USB Gadget mode.</p>
<h2>Cross-Toolchains</h2>
<p>I build a custom Ada/C/C++/Fortran/Go/Modula-2 GCC cross-toolchain for each
<b>MuntsOS</b> platform family. Each GCC cross-toolchain requires a number of
additional software component libraries, which are packaged and distributed
separately but installed into the same directory tree as the parent
cross-toolchain. I also build <a href="https://www.freepascal.org">Free
Pascal</a> cross-compilers. Each of these rely on the libraries contained in
the corresponding GCC cross-toolchain package.</p>
<p>Cross-toolchain packages built for <a href=
"https://www.debian.org">Debian</a> Linux (x86-64 <i>and</i> ARM64) development
host computers are available at either:</p>

Fedora 40 and RHEL 9.1 and its derivatives, are available at:</p>

<p>Adding the <b><tt>muntsos_aarch64</tt></b> crate to an Alire Ada program
project transforms said project into one that produces a cross-compiled AArch64
program for <b>MuntsOS</b>. See <a href=

Note #7</a> for a complete example using the <b><tt>alr</tt></b> command line

<p><b><tt>muntsos_aarch64</tt></b> depends upon the Linux distribution
meta-package <b><tt>muntsos-dev-aarch64</tt></b> that in turn pulls in the rest

<p id="alire_orphans">Please note that the other <b>MuntsOS</b> library crates
in Alire (<i>e.g.</i> <b>muntsos_beaglebone</b>) are unusable due to breaking
changes in <b><tt>alr</tt></b> 2.0. Unfortunately, Alire project policies
prohibit removing obsolete crates, so <b>muntsos_beaglebone</b> <i>et al</i>
remain in the repository as broken and abandoned orphans.</p>

build</tt></b>, <b><tt>dotnet publish</tt></b>, <b><tt>dotnet pack</tt></b> or
the equivalent actions in <a href=
"https://visualstudio.microsoft.com">Microsoft Visual Studio</a>. Many if not
most of the library packages published on <a href=
"https://www.nuget.org">NuGet</a> can be used in such programs.</p>
<p>The NuGet library package <a href=
"https://www.nuget.org/packages/libsimpleio">libsimpleio</a> provides
<b><tt>libsimpleio.dll</tt></b>, a .Net Standard 2.0 library assembly that
binds to the Linux shared library <b><tt>libsimpleio.so</tt></b> that is an
integral part of <b>MuntsOS</b>. The NuGet library package <a href=
"https://www.nuget.org/packages/libsimpleio">libsimpleio-templates</a> provides
a .Net Core console application project template
<b><tt>csharp_console_libsimpleio</tt></b> that, while not strictly necessary,
greatly simplifies creating an .Net Core console embedded system application
project for <b>MuntsOS</b>.</p>
<pre><b>
