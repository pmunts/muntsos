<h1>MuntsOS Embedded Linux</h1>
<p>This framework supports Linux on several single board
microcomputers. The goal of the MuntsOS project is to deliver a
turnkey, RAM resident Linux operating system for very low cost
single board microcomputers. With MuntsOS installed, such
microcomputers can treated as components, as <i>Linux
microcontrollers</i>, and integrated into other projects just like
traditional single chip microcontrollers.</p>
<h2>News</h2>
<ul>
<li>17 December 2024 -- Moved all 32-bit target deliverables
(toolchain packages, kernels, extensions, and thin servers) to
<a href=
"http://repo.munts.com/muntsos/attic">http://repo.munts.com/muntsos/attic</a>.
I did a final build of the 32-bit target kernels with
<b><tt>sysconfig</tt></b> modified to fetch extensions from the
attic. I do not anticipate ever building the 32-bit target kernels
or thin servers again.</li>
<br>
<li>20 December 2024 -- Upgraded the Raspberry Pi kernel to 6.6.67.
Added a new device tree overlay, <b><tt>Pi4ClickShield</tt></b>, to
support the eponymous <a href=
"https://www.mikroe.com/pi-4-click-shield">mikroBUS
shield</a>.</li>
<br>
<li>26 December 2024 -- Added <i>preliminary</i> support for the
<a href=
"http://www.orangepi.org/orangepiwiki/index.php/Orange_Pi_Zero_2W">Orange
Pi Zero 2W</a>. I have the <a href=
"https://www.u-boot.org">U-Boot</a> boot loader and the Linux
mainline 6.12 LTS kernel, both with serial port console, working
all the way to the login prompt. Much work on the kernel and device
tree remains before MuntsOS on the Orange Pi Zero 2W is ready for
production use.</li>
<br>
<li>28 December 2024 -- I had to drop back to the manufacturer
Linux 6.1 kernel tree for the Orange Pi Zero 2W. The Linux mainline
6.12 LTS tree does not have drivers for PWM outputs nor the
built-in WiFi chipset, both of which are required for the
application I have in mind. MuntsOS for the Orange Pi Zero 2W built
on Linux 6.1 is about at the same point or a litte further along
than what I had running on Linux 6.12 LTS. Most things seem to be
working except HDMI and internal WiFi. I have been testing with a

<h2>Embedded Linux Distribution in a Kernel</h2>
<p>MuntsOS is a stripped down Linux distribution that includes a
small compressed root file system within the kernel image binary
itself. At boot time the root file system is unpacked into RAM and
thereafter the system runs entirely in RAM.</p>
<p>Each kernel release tarball contains a kernel image file
(<b><tt>.img</tt></b>), which may be common to several different
microcomputer boards, and one or more <a href=
"http://elinux.org/Device_Tree_Reference">device tree</a> files
(<b><tt>.dtb</tt></b>) that are specific to particular
microcomputer boards. Some kernel release tarballs also contain one
or more device tree overlay files (<b><tt>.dtbo</tt></b>) that can
make small changes to the device tree at boot time.</p>
<p>Prebuilt MuntsOS kernel release tarballs are available at:</p>
<p><a href=
"http://repo.munts.com/muntsos/kernels">http://repo.munts.com/muntsos/kernels</a></p>
<h2>Extensions</h2>
<p>The MuntsOS root file system can be <i>extended</i> at boot time
using any of three mechanisms:</p>
<p>First, if <b><tt>/boot/tarballs</tt></b> exists, any
<b><tt>gzip</tt></b>'ed tarball files (<b><tt>.tgz</tt></b>) in it
will be extracted on top of the root file system. Typically you
would use this mechanism for customized
<b><tt>/etc/passwd</tt></b>, <b><tt>.ssh/authorized_keys</tt></b>,
and similiar system configuration files.</p>
<p>Secondly, if <b><tt>/boot/packages</tt></b> exists, any Debian
package files (<b><tt>.deb</tt></b>) in it will be installed into
the root file system. Note that packages from the <a href=
"http://www.debian.org">Debian</a> project will probably not work;
they must be built specifically for MuntsOS. The startup script
that installs <b><tt>.deb</tt></b> packages also installs
<b><tt>.rpm</tt></b> and <b><tt>.nupkg</tt></b> packages.</p>
<p>The <a href=
"http://git.munts.com/muntsos/extensions/gpio-server">GPIO
Server</a> extension package demonstrates how to build a Debian
package that adds application specific software to MuntsOS.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the system startup script <b><tt>/etc/rc</tt></b> can
be configured via a kernel command line option to search for a
subdirectory called <b><tt>autoexec.d</tt></b> in various places,
such as SD card, USB flash drive, USB CD-ROM or NFS mount. If an
<b><tt>autoexec.d</tt></b> subdirectory is found, each executable
program or script in it will be executed when the system boots.</p>
<p>The idea is to build a MuntsOS kernel (which takes a long time)
once and install it to the target platform. Then application
specific software can be built after the fact and installed as
tarball files in <b><tt>/boot/tarballs</tt></b>; Debian, RPM, and
NuGet package files in <b><tt>/boot/packages</tt></b>; or
executable programs and scripts in
<b><tt>/boot/autoexec.d</tt></b>.</p>
<p>Prebuilt MuntsOS extension packages are available at:</p>
<p><a href=
"http://repo.munts.com/muntsos/extensions">http://repo.munts.com/muntsos/extensions</a></p>
<h2>Thin Servers</h2>
<h3>Boot Files + Kernel Files + Extensions = Thin Server</h3>
<p>The <i>Thin Server</i> is a system design pattern that is little
more than a network interface for a single I/O device. Ideally, a
Thin Server will be built from a cheap and ubiquitous network
microcomputer like the Raspberry Pi. The software must be easy to
install from a user's PC or Mac without requiring any special
programming tools. It must be able to run headless, administered
via the network. It must be able to survive without orderly
shutdowns, and must not write much to flash media. It must provide
a network based API (Application Programming Interface) using HTTP
as a lowest common denominator.</p>
<p>MuntsOS, with its operating system running entirely from RAM,
serves well for the Thin Server, and the two concepts have evolved
together over the past few years. The simplest way to use MuntsOS
is to download one of the prebuilt Thin Server <b><tt>.zip</tt></b>
files and extract it to a freshly formatted FAT32 SD card. You can
then modify <b><tt>autoexec.d/00-wlan-init</tt></b> on the SD card
to pre-configure it for your wireless network environment, if
desired, before inserting it in the target board. After booting
MuntsOS, log in from the console or via SSH (user
"<b><tt>root</tt></b>", password "<b><tt>default</tt></b>") and run
<b><tt>sysconfig</tt></b> to perform more system configuration.</p>
<p><i>Note: Some platforms require the <a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boot_flag">boot flag</a> to be set
on the FAT32 boot partition on the SD card or on-board eMMC. The
ROM boot loader in the CPU will ignore any partitions that are not
marked as bootable.</i></p>

<h2>Boards</h2>
<h3>Orange Pi Zero 2W</h3>
<p>The <a href=
"http://www.orangepi.org/orangepiwiki/index.php/Orange_Pi_Zero_2W">Orange
Pi Zero 2W</a> is a small Linux microcomputer with a form factor
very similiar to the <a href=
"https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-2-w/">Raspberry
Pi Zero 2 W</a>, making it ideal for embedded system projects. It
has a 1500 MHz Allwinner H618 Cortex-A53 quad-core CPU and comes
with 1 to 4 GB of RAM and on-board Bluetooth and WiFi radios. It is
available for sale on Amazon for $21.99 (1 GB RAM) to $33.99 (4 GB
RAM).</p>
<p>The much larger RAM is a big advantage and I have been able to
purchase as many as I want without limits when the Raspberry Pi
Zero 2 W has been unavailable. Unfortunately, the manufacturer
<a href=
"https://github.com/orangepi-xunlong/linux-orangepi/tree/orange-pi-6.1-sun50iw9">
kernel source tree</a> has not been maintained regularly and is
currently at 6.1.31.</p>
<h3>Raspberry Pi</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.com">Raspberry Pi</a> is a
family of low cost Linux microcomputers selling for USD $15 to $80,
depending on model. There have been five generations of Raspberry
Pi microcomputers, each using a successively more sophisticated
Broadcom ARM core CPU. The first two generations (32-bit ARMv6
Raspberry Pi 1 and 32-bit ARMv7 Raspberry Pi 2) are now
obsolete.</p>
<p>Some Raspberry Pi models have an on-board Bluetooth radio that
uses the serial port signals that are also brought out to the
expansion header. By default, MuntsOS port disables the on-board
Bluetooth radio, in favor of the serial port on the expansion
header.</p>
<p>All of the following 64-bit Raspberry Pi models use the same
AArch64 cross-toolchain.</p>
<h4>Raspberry Pi 3</h4>
<p>The <a href=
"https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b">Raspberry
Pi 2 Model B</a> Revision 1.2 with the 900 MHz BCM2710 ARMv8
Cortex-A53 quad-core CPU can be treated as a power conserving
Raspberry Pi 3 Model B− and is useful for industrial applications
where wired Ethernet is preferred.</p>
<p>The <a href=
"https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b">Rasbperry
Pi 3 Model B</a> has a 1200 MHz BCM2710 ARMv8 Cortex-A53 quad-core
CPU and has 1 GB of RAM along with on-board Bluetooth and WiFi
radios.</p>
<p>The <a href=
"https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-a-plus">Raspberry
Pi 3 Model A+</a> has the same form factor as the Raspberry Pi 1
Model A+, with only one USB host port and no wired Ethernet. It has
a 1400 MHz BCM2710 ARMv8 Cortex-A53 quad-core CPU and has 512 MB of
RAM along with on-board Bluetooth and WiFi radios.</p>
<p>The <a href=
"https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus">Raspberry
Pi 3 Model B+</a> has a 1400 MHz BCM2710 ARMv8 Cortex-A53 quad-core
CPU and has improved power management and networking
components.</p>
<p>The <a href=
"https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-2-w">Raspberry
Pi Zero 2 W</a> has the same form factor as the Raspberry Pi Zero
W, with a 1000 MHz BCM2710 ARMv8 Cortex-A53 quad core CPU and 512
MB of RAM along with on-board Bluetooth and WiFi radios. This
small, light, and inexpensive board is probably one of the best
Linux microcomputers available for implementing embedded
systems.</p>
<p>All Raspberry Pi 3 models use the same ARMv8 kernel, with
different device trees.</p>
<h4>Raspberry Pi 4</h4>
<p>The <a href=
"https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b">Raspberry
Pi 4 Model B</a> has a 1500 MHz BCM2711 ARMv8 Cortex-A72 quad-core
CPU and is available with 1 to 8 GB of RAM. It diverged
significantly from the Raspberry Pi 1 B+ form factor, with the USB
and Ethernet ports reversed, two micro-HDMI connectors instead of a
single full size HDMI connector, and a USB-C power connector
instead of micro-USB. Two of the USB ports are 3.0 and two are 2.0.
A major improvement is a Gigabit Ethernet controller connected via
PCI Express instead of the USB connected Ethernet used for all
earlier models. The Raspberry Pi 4 Model B uses the same wireless
chip set as the 3+.</p>
<p>There are also a myriad of <a href=
"https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/compute-module-4">Raspberry
Pi 4 Compute Modules</a>, with varying combinations of wireless
Ethernet, RAM and eMMC.</p>
<p>All Raspberry Pi 4 models use the same ARMv8 kernel, with
different device trees.</p>
<h4>Raspberry Pi 5</h4>
<p>The <a href=
"https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-5">Raspberry Pi
5</a> yields another 2-3x increase in performance over the
Raspberry Pi 4, at the expense of greater power consumption. It has
a 2400 MHz BCM2712 ARMv8 Cortex-A76 quad-core CPU and is available
with 4 or 8 GB of RAM. The Ethernet socket and USB ports have
swapped sides, so it has a form factor that is sort of a cross
between the Raspberry Pi 1 B+ (same grouping of Ethernet and USB
ports) and the Raspberry Pi 4 (same dual micro-HDMI sockets and
USB-C power socket).</p>
<p>There are also a myriad of <a href=
"https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/compute-module-5">Raspberry
Pi 5 Compute Modules</a>, with varying combinations of wireless
Ethernet, RAM and eMMC.</p>
<p>All Raspberry Pi 5 models use the same ARMv8 kernel, with
different device trees.</p>
<p>The Raspberry Pi 5 introduced a breaking GPIO API change. See
<a href=
"http://git.munts.com/muntsos/doc/AppNote11-link-gpiochip.pdf">Application
Note #11</a> for more information.</p>
<p>The Raspberry Pi 5 also introduced a breaking PWM API change. It
has four hardware PWM outputs with different pin mapping. Notably,
PWM chip 2 channel 2 is mapped to GPIO18 instead of PWM chip 0
channel 0 on previous Raspberry Pi boards. See <a href=
"https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/rp1/rp1-peripherals.pdf">RP1
Peripherals</a> page 15 for more information.</p>
<h4>Raspberry Pi USB Gadget Kernels</h4>
<p>MuntsOS also provides Raspberry Pi kernels with dedicated
<a href="http://www.linux-usb.org/gadget">USB Gadget</a> support
enabled. These kernels run on 3 A+, CM3, Zero 2 W, 4 B, and CM4.
You can supply power to and communicate with a compatible Raspberry
Pi solely through the USB port. This kernel supports USB Network,
Raw HID, and Serial Port gadgets, selected by bits in the
<b><tt>OPTIONS</tt></b> word passed on the kernel command line. The
USB Gadget Thin Servers have USB Network Gadget selected by
default.</p>
<p>The absolute minimum possible usable Raspberry Pi kit consists
of a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, a micro-USB cable, and a micro-SD card
with one of the MuntsOS Raspberry Pi 3 USB Gadget Thin Servers
installed.</p>
<h2>Cross-Toolchains</h2>
<p>I build a custom Ada/C/C++/Fortran/Go/Modula-2 GCC
cross-toolchain for each MuntsOS platform family. Each GCC
cross-toolchain requires a number of additional software component
libraries, which are packaged and distributed separately but
installed into the same directory tree as the parent
cross-toolchain. I also build <a href=
"https://www.freepascal.org">Free Pascal</a> cross-compilers. Each
of these rely on the libraries contained in the corresponding GCC
cross-toolchain package.</p>
