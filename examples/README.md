Embedded Linux Example Programs
===============================

Here are some example programs for embedded Linux systems. They are
primarily written for the cross-compiled [MuntsOS Embedded Linux
Framework](https://github.com/pmunts/muntsos), but they can also be
built with native compilers for conventional Linux distributions such as
Debian.

Most of these example programs depend on
[**libsimpleio**](https://github.com/pmunts/libsimpleio), the Linux
Simple I/O Library.
