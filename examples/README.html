<h1>Embedded Linux Example Programs</h1>
<p>Here are some example programs for embedded Linux systems. They are
primarily written for the cross-compiled <a href=
"https://github.com/pmunts/muntsos">MuntsOS Embedded Linux Framework</a>, but
they can also be built with native compilers for conventional Linux
distributions such as Debian.</p>
<p>Most of these example programs depend on <a href=
"https://github.com/pmunts/libsimpleio"><b>libsimpleio</b></a>, the Linux Simple I/O
Library.</p>
