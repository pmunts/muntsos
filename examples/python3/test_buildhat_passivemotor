# This test program requires the Raspberry Pi Build HAT and the python3 and
# buildhat-python3 MuntsOS Embedded Linux extension packages.
#
# Tested with a LEGOÂ® Power Functions M-Motor 8883 connected to the Build HAT
# with a PV-Productions Powered Up to Power Functions Adapter cable
# (https://pv-productions.com/product/powered-up-to-power-functions-adapter).

import buildhat
import time

M0 = buildhat.PassiveMotor('A')
M0.plimit(1.0)

# Kick motor full power to start rotation

M0.start(100)
time.sleep(0.02)

# Now reduce speed

M0.start(2)
time.sleep(5)
