Embedded Linux Example Programs

Here are some example programs for embedded Linux systems. They are
primarily written for the cross-compiled MuntsOS Embedded Linux
Framework, but they can also be built with native compilers for
conventional Linux distributions such as Debian.

Most of these example programs depend on libsimpleio, the Linux Simple
I/O Library.
